/*
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
For example:
	2 is a prime number (divisible only by 1 and 2)
	3 is a prime number (divisible only by 1 and 3).
	4 is not a prime number (divisible by 1, 2, and 4).
	5 is a prime number (divisible only by 1 and 5)
